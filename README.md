# Shreder

Idk what I thought, I just took Marshall Shredmaster and modified a bit, so it has 2 input channels, different clipping settings, and a bit different filters, so it's a bit more bright. I find those '90s distortions too dark, especially with a very dark guitar.

The dumbest thing is "BOOM!" switch that simply connects those to input channels in series to get an ridiculus amount of gain, because GAIN!


It can be made to sound good. The final product:
